# WARNING: MetalLB is currently supported, however dynamic provisioning is NOT currently      #
# supported despite the explanation below. This will come in a later release, however, if you #
# are interested in using this feature you will need to modify the configmap located in the   #
# MetalLB files directory yourself to match the variables you declare here.                   #
#                                                                                             #
# These parameters are only required if you want to enable on-prem load balancing with        #
# MetalLB. The MetalLB configuration file will be dynamically provisioned based on how many   #
# variable sets you declare below. This is intended to allow you to provision a single or     #
# multiple address pools depending on your personal network configuration. The configuration  #
# is dynamically generated based on how many sets of variables you list below. For example:   #
#                                                                                             #
# If you wish to deploy a single address pool, you would declare these three variables.       #
#                                                                                             #
